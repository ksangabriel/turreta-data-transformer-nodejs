# Turreta Data Transformer (DT)
TDT is a framework written in TypeScript for NodeJS for creating tasks that go through common life-cycle within the framework itself. It helps by providing developers a platform on which they can rapidly develop tasks ran in the command-line interface or in the background. 

It is still in its infancy but already a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

It uses the following:
1. NodeJS
2. TypeScript
3. Inversify

TODO items
1. Documentation
2. Unit tests
3. New use cases (types of transformation, e.g., XML-to-HTML)
